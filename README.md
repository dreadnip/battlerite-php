# Battlerite-php
PHP/Guzzle wrapper for the newly released Battlerite API. Very WIP, the API came out yesterday so don't expect things to work right now. I'll update this repo as soon as the developers update the API and things get more mature.

#### License
MIT

#### Version
0.0.1

for PHP 5.6+

## Usage

Download or clone, run composer install, check out the example

All the functions are documented inside the class, so take a look inside if you're going to be using this wrapper.

### To do

* Make things work
* Make things work with Pools/concurrent requests
* Add any endpoints the devs open up
